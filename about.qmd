# About the project

Invasion of alien species is one of the five major drivers of biodiversity loss (Bellard et al., 2022) and is ecologically and economically of grave concern. Urban areas often serve as hotspots for the entry and establishment of invasive alien species (IAS). Many IAS are successful in urban environments because of having certain fitness-related traits that are advantageous in an urban ecosystem (Byers, 2002).

However, urbanization also creates anthropogenic disturbance, which alters the community and population structures and offers windows of opportunity for the successful establishment of alien species. Certain traits of the IAS, e.g., high photosynthetic and growth rate (Van Kleunen et al., 2010). 2010), high resource use efficiency on short time scales (Funk & Vitousek, 2007), makes them successful at exploiting these opportunities. Moreover, IAS can also change their existing traits in response to the changes in their physical environment. In fact, the plasticity of fitness-related traits has been identified as the key mechanism for successful invasion (Davidson et al., 2011; Valladares et al., 2007). Being plastic often allows IAS to quickly adapt to the new environment and to maintain higher fitness relative to the native taxa, thereby establishing dominance in the community (Sultan, 2001). Therefore, it is not surprising that most studies confirm the positive effect of disturbance on the successful invasion of alien species. However, the relationship between disturbance and invasiveness varies across different species and ecosystems.

In India, very few studies have explored trait modulation strategies for the invasive alien plant species (IAPS) growing in an urban environment (e.g., *Ricinus communis* (Goyal et al., 2014)). Precise locally collected data available from different regions and environments (Moravcová et al., 2015), especially for the most serious invaders, would aid in obtaining meaningful results.

This project is, therefore, formulated to assess whether urban disturbance sharpens the invasive potential and increases the chance of successful invasion. The overarching hypothesis is that invasive species modify certain traits to take advantage of the disturbances in urban systems that enhance their invasive potential.

In this project, we studied phenotypic plasticity of certain characters in *Parthenium hysterophorus* in response to a disturbance gradient in Bhopal. The study area was stratified into two primary factors to capture environmental variability:

-   **Spatial Stratification:** Four distinct water bodies (Lakes/Dams) were selected to account for localized hydrological and micro-climatic differences across Bhopal.

-   **Anthropogenic Stratification:** Within each site, three distinct Habitats were identified: Roadsides (high disturbance), Natural areas (moderate/periodic disturbance), and Abandoned plots (low disturbance).

At each combination of Lake and Habitat, we used a **1 sq.m.** quadrat as the standard sampling unit (SSU). From each SSU, we estimated the following traits:

-   Dry above-ground biomass (studied invasive and associated species)
-   Maximum height (studied invasive species)
-   Specific leaf area (studied invasive species)
-   Leaf dry matter content (studied invasive species)
-   Species richness

The data was analyzed to

1.  Compare above-ground biomass between species and across different environmental gradients
2.  Investigate the influence of associated species on Parthenium hysterophorus and vice versa
3.  Compare the leaf-related traits across different environmental gradients
