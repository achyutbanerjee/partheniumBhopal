    "text": "About the project\nInvasion of alien species is one of the five major drivers of biodiversity loss (Bellard et al., 2022) and is ecologically and economically of grave concern. Urban areas often serve as hotspots for the entry and establishment of invasive alien species (IAS). Many IAS are successful in urban environments because of having certain fitness-related traits that are advantageous in an urban ecosystem (Byers, 2002).\nHowever, urbanization also creates anthropogenic disturbance, which alters the community and population structures and offers windows of opportunity for the successful establishment of alien species. Certain traits of the IAS, e.g., high photosynthetic and growth rate (Van Kleunen et al., 2010). 2010), high resource use efficiency on short time scales (Funk & Vitousek, 2007), makes them successful at exploiting these opportunities. Moreover, IAS can also change their existing traits in response to the changes in their physical environment. In fact, the plasticity of fitness-related traits has been identified as the key mechanism for successful invasion (Davidson et al., 2011; Valladares et al., 2007). Being plastic often allows IAS to quickly adapt to the new environment and to maintain higher fitness relative to the native taxa, thereby establishing dominance in the community (Sultan, 2001). Therefore, it is not surprising that most studies confirm the positive effect of disturbance on the successful invasion of alien species. However, the relationship between disturbance and invasiveness varies across different species and ecosystems.\nIn India, very few studies have explored trait modulation strategies for the invasive alien plant species (IAPS) growing in an urban environment (e.g., Ricinus communis (Goyal et al., 2014)). Precise locally collected data available from different regions and environments (Moravcová et al., 2015), especially for the most serious invaders, would aid in obtaining meaningful results.\nThis project is, therefore, formulated to assess whether urban disturbance sharpens the invasive potential and increases the chance of successful invasion. The overarching hypothesis is that invasive species modify certain traits to take advantage of the disturbances in urban systems that enhance their invasive potential.\nIn this project, we studied phenotypic plasticity of certain characters in Parthenium hysterophorus in response to a disturbance gradient in Bhopal. The study area was stratified into two primary factors to capture environmental variability:\n\nSpatial Stratification: Four distinct water bodies (Lakes/Dams) were selected to account for localized hydrological and micro-climatic differences across Bhopal.\nAnthropogenic Stratification: Within each site, three distinct Habitats were identified: Roadsides (high disturbance), Natural areas (moderate/periodic disturbance), and Abandoned plots (low disturbance).\n\nAt each combination of Lake and Habitat, we used a 1 sq.m. quadrat as the standard sampling unit (SSU). From each SSU, we estimated the following traits:\n\nDry above-ground biomass (studied invasive and associated species)\nMaximum height (studied invasive species)\nSpecific leaf area (studied invasive species)\nLeaf dry matter content (studied invasive species)\nSpecies richness\n\nThe data was analyzed to\n\nCompare above-ground biomass between species and across different environmental gradients\nInvestigate the influence of associated species on Parthenium hysterophorus and vice versa\nCompare the leaf-related traits across different environmental gradients"

    "text": "About the variable\nWe used 1 sq.m. quadrat as the standard sampling unit. At each combination of lake and habitat, we used three quadrats (n = 4x3 = 12). From each quadrat:\n\nAll above-ground plant material of Parthenium within each quadrat was clipped at ground level. We utilized the destructive harvest method to ensure maximum accuracy.\nThe samples were cleaned of debris and oven-dried at 720C until a constant weight was reached.\nDry weight was recorded, eliminating the variability caused by fluctuating water content in live plants, thus providing a true measure of carbon sequestration and resource allocation. The standardized area allows for the calculation of biomass per unit area.\n\nWe also recorded number of associated species in each quadrat (species richness). The number of associated species varies from 2 to 11. We estimated dry weight of all associated species individually. For comparative analysis, we used the sum of all species within a quadrat at a specific lake x habitat combination.\nDry Above-Ground Biomass (AGB, hereafter) serves as a critical indicator of invasion success. It is a physical manifestation of a plant’s ability to capture resources (light, water, and nutrients). Therefore, high biomass in Parthenium indicates high resource use efficiency. In addition, larger plants with higher biomass typically produce a greater number of seeds (often up to 25,000 seeds per plant for Parthenium). Therefore, AGB can be considered as a proxy for propagule pressure.\nComparing AGB across different habitats (e.g., roadside vs. natural areas vs. abandoned plots) reveals how environmental stressors or anthropogenic disturbances facilitate invasion. Roadsides often act as invasion corridors with higher nutrient runoff, leading to higher biomass compared to more stable abandoned plots."

This step is critical for verifying the homoscedasticity assumption required for parametric tests like ANOVA. Levene’s test is more robust to departures from normality. A non-significant result (\\(p &lt; 0.05\\)) indicates that the variances are approximately equal across groups. We are using the car package to do this analysis.\n\nleveneTest(Dry.weight ~ group1, data = data)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nleveneTest(Dry.weight ~ group2, data = data)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nleveneTest(Dry.weight_O ~ group1, data = data)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nleveneTest(Dry.weight_O ~ group2, data = data)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nComparison: One-way ANOVA\nA One-Way ANOVA is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups based on one single factor.\n\nIndependent variable (factor): 3 categories of habitats / 4 categories of lakes\nDependent variable: Above-ground dry biomass\n\nWe will do 3 things here:\n\nBecause the previous diagnostic checks (Shapiro-Wilk or Levene’s) indicated a violation of parametric assumptions, we employ the Kruskal-Wallis test. This is a non-parametric alternative to a one-way ANOVA that does not require the data to follow a normal distribution. Instead of comparing means, it transforms the data into ranks and tests whether the samples originate from the same distribution. A significant p-value (p&lt;0.05) suggests that at least one group stochastically dominates another.\nWhen reporting a Kruskal-Wallis test, a p-value only tells you if groups differ, not how much they differ. To quantify the magnitude of the difference, we calculate the Effect Size. For non-parametric data, the most common metric is Eta-squared (η2).\nWhen the Kruskal-Wallis test yields a significant result, it indicates that at least one group differs from the others, but it does not specify which pairs are different. To pinpoint these differences, we conduct a Dunn’s Test, which is the standard non-parametric post-hoc procedure. We are using the FSA package to do this analysis.\n\nFirst, we will do it for Parthenium\n\n# Group 1 (Lake)\nkruskal.test(Dry.weight ~ group1, data = data)\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  Dry.weight by group1\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 14.248, df = 3, p-value = 0.002587\n\nkruskal_effsize(Dry.weight ~ group1,data = data) # effect size estimation\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThe KW test showed significant difference in AGB of Parthenium across lakes.\nThe effect size is large.\n\n\n\n\ndunnTest(Dry.weight~group1,data=data) #posthoc test\n\nDunn (1964) Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison\n\n\n  p-values adjusted with the Holm method.\n\n\n                    Comparison          Z      P.unadj       P.adj\n1  Hathaikheda_Dam - Kerwa_Dam  0.6722514 0.5014236945 0.501423694\n2 Hathaikheda_Dam - Lower_Lake -0.7360699 0.4616881414 0.923376283\n3       Kerwa_Dam - Lower_Lake -1.3863441 0.1656418648 0.496925594\n4 Hathaikheda_Dam - Upper_Lake -2.9212775 0.0034859914 0.017429957\n5       Kerwa_Dam - Upper_Lake -3.5063068 0.0004543711 0.002726227\n6      Lower_Lake - Upper_Lake -2.1852076 0.0288736282 0.115494513\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThe posthoc Dunn test revealed that Parthenium AGB in Upper Lake is significantly higher than that in Kerwa Dam and Hathaikheda Dam.\n\n\n\n\n# Group 2 (Habitat)\nkruskal.test(Dry.weight ~ group2, data = data) \n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  Dry.weight by group2\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 1.5662, df = 2, p-value = 0.457\n\nkruskal_effsize(Dry.weight ~ group2,data = data) # effect size estimation\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThe KW test showed no significant difference in AGB of Parthenium across habitats.

It not only tells you if each factor is significant on its own (Main Effects) but also if the factors work together in a specific way (Interaction Effect).\n\nIndependent variable (factor): 3 categories of habitats and 4 categories of lakes\nDependent variable: Above-ground dry biomass\n\nWhen analyzing the influence of two independent variables on a non-normally distributed dependent variable, traditional non-parametric tests like Kruskal-Wallis are insufficient because they cannot test for interactions. To address this, we use the Aligned Rank Transform (ART).\nART works by “aligning” the data for each effect (Main Effects and Interaction) before ranking them. This process isolates each specific effect, allowing us to apply standard ANOVA procedures to the ranked data. This provides a statistically sound method to determine if the effect of one factor depends on the level of another, even when parametric assumptions are violated.\nTo identify specific differences following a significant ART interaction, we conduct pairwise comparisons using the art.con() function. This method ensures that the comparisons are performed on the correctly aligned and ranked data for the effect of interest. We apply a p-value adjustment (e.g., Holm) to control for the family-wise error rate across multiple comparisons.We are using the ARTool package to do this analysis.\nFirst, we will do it for Parthenium\n\nart_model &lt;- art(Dry.weight ~ group1 * group2, data = data) # model building\nanova_art &lt;- anova(art_model) # conducting anova\nprint(anova_art) # print the results\n\nAnalysis of Variance of Aligned Rank Transformed Data\n\nTable Type: Anova Table (Type III tests) \nModel: No Repeated Measures (lm)\nResponse: art(Dry.weight)\n\n                Df Df.res F value     Pr(&gt;F)    \n1 group1         3     23 10.4292 0.00015849 ***\n2 group2         2     23  3.0187 0.06852839   .\n3 group1:group2  6     23  3.0259 0.02490477   *\n---\nSignif. codes:   0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSummary of two-way ANOVA:\n\nThe ART analysis revealed significant effect of group 1 (Lake) and the interaction of group 1 and group 2 (Lake x Habitat) on the AGB of Parthenium.\nSo, we will conduct the posthoc tests only for group 1 and group1:group2 interactions.\n\n\n\n\n# pairwise comparisons for one variable\nmarginal = art.con(art_model, \"group1\") \n\nNOTE: Results may be misleading due to involvement in interactions\n\nprint(marginal)\n\n contrast                     estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n Hathaikheda_Dam - Kerwa_Dam      2.33 3.90 23   0.598  0.9318\n Hathaikheda_Dam - Lower_Lake    -5.33 3.75 23  -1.422  0.4992\n Hathaikheda_Dam - Upper_Lake   -17.22 3.75 23  -4.591  0.0007\n Kerwa_Dam - Lower_Lake          -7.67 3.90 23  -1.963  0.2307\n Kerwa_Dam - Upper_Lake         -19.56 3.90 23  -5.008  0.0003\n Lower_Lake - Upper_Lake        -11.89 3.75 23  -3.169  0.0207\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: group2 \nP value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 4 estimates \n\n# pairwise comparisons for interactions\nmarginal1 = art.con(art_model, \"group1:group2\", adjust=\"holm\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSummary of pairwise comparisons:\n\nThe AGB of Parthenium in Upper Lake is significantly higher than that in the Lower Lake, Kerwa Dam and Hathaikheda Dam, after adjusting for the effects of the habitats.

    "text": "About the variable\nSpecific Leaf Area (SLA) and Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC) are the two primary indicators of a plant’s position on the Leaf Economic Spectrum. They describe how a plant invests its carbon.\n\nSampling strategy\n\nHierarchical Sampling Design: A multi-scale sampling approach was employed to capture the trait plasticity of Parthenium hysterophorus. The study followed a nested design: 4 Lakes (Regional scale) × 3 Habitats (Landscape scale: Roadside, Abandoned, Natural) × 3 Sites (Local scale) per combination.\nTo account for within-site variability and minimize the effects of leaf age (ontogeny), 10 healthy, fully expanded leaves were collected from different individuals at each site (N=360 leaves total). This high-resolution sampling allows for the assessment of how Parthenium modulates its resource-use efficiency (SLA) and structural investment (LDMC) in response to varying levels of anthropogenic disturbance and environmental heterogeneity across the Bhopal lake system.\n\n\n\nAbout Specific Leaf Area\nSLA is the ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass (mm²/mg or cm²/g).\n\nRelevance: It measures the “speed” of a plant’s metabolism.\nIn this study: High SLA indicates thin, “expensive” leaves that are built for rapid photosynthesis and fast growth. If Parthenium shows higher SLA in Roadside habitats compared to Natural ones, it suggests the weed is switching to an “acquisitive” strategy to exploit the higher light or nutrient availability often found in disturbed areas.\n\n\n\nAbout Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC)\nLDMC is the ratio of leaf dry mass to its fresh mass (mg/g).\n\nRelevance: It measures leaf density and “toughness.” It is often inversely related to SLA.\nIn this study: High LDMC indicates a “conservative” strategy. These leaves are sturdier, better protected against wilting (desiccation), and more resistant to herbivores. If Parthenium in Abandoned or Natural sites has higher LDMC, it suggests the plant is investing in leaf longevity and stress tolerance to survive in more competitive or resource-limited environments."

Because “Lake” and “Habitat” are categorical, R uses Dummy Coding. This means it picks one category as the “Baseline” (Intercept) and compares everyone else to it.\nThe Intercept\nWhat it is: The predicted mean SLA for the reference group (Hathaikheda_Dam and Abandoned habitat, based on alphabetical order).\nSignificance: If the p-value is &lt;0.05, the SLA for this specific baseline group is significantly different from zero (which is expected for biological traits).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntercept is significant. The SLA for Parthenium in Abandoned Habitat of Hathaikheda Dam is significantly different from zero.\n\n\n\nMain Effects (e.g., LakeLower_Lake or HabitatRoadside)\nLake Effect: If LakeLower_Lake is positive and significant, it means that in the “Abandoned” habitat, Lower Lake has significantly higher SLA than Hathaikheda Dam.\nHabitat Effect: If HabitatRoadside is significant, it means that in Hathaikheda Dam, the Roadside habitat has a different SLA than the Abandoned habitat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLakeLower_Lake is positive and significant = In the “Abandoned” habitat, Lower Lake has significantly higher SLA than Hathaikheda Dam.\nLakeUpper_Lake is positive and significant = In the “Abandoned” habitat, Upper Lake has significantly higher SLA than Hathaikheda Dam.\n\n\n\n\nThe Interaction Terms (e.g., LakeUpper_Lake:HabitatNatural)\nThis is the most important part for our “plasticity” argument.\nIf Significant: It means the way Parthenium responds to a habitat depends on which lake it is in. For example, Parthenium might increase its SLA on roadsides in the Upper Lake but decrease it on roadsides in Kerwa Dam.\nIf NOT Significant: It means Parthenium responds to habitats in the same way across all lakes. This suggests a universal strategy for the species in this region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLakeUpper_Lake:HabitatNatural is significant. It’s not just that Upper Lake has high SLA. It’s not just that Natural habitats have high SLA. It is that specifically in Upper Lake, the Natural habitat triggers a massive jump in SLA that we don’t see in the Natural habitats of the Dams. Parthenium increases its SLA significantly in natural habitat in the Upper Lake.\nThe SLA of Parthenium in the Natural habitats of Upper Lake (≈8060 mm2/mg) was significantly higher than the baseline (Hathaikheda Dam/Abandoned, ≈2815 mm2/mg). The significant interaction term LakeUpper_Lake:HabitatNatural (p&lt;0.05) confirms that this increase represents a unique phenotypic shift toward an acquisitive leaf strategy specifically within the Upper Lake ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSummary of the findings:\n\nLake Effect: Highly Significant (p&lt;0.001). This is the biggest driver of SLA variation. Plants in Lower Lake and Upper Lake generally have much higher SLA (thinner, faster-growing leaves) than those in the Dams.\nHabitat Effect: Not significant on its own.\nInteraction Effect: Significant (p&lt;0.01). This is crucial. It tells us that Parthenium doesn’t behave the same way in every lake. For example, it might love the “Natural” habitat in one lake but perform poorly in it in another.\n\n\n\n\nTidying up the summary table\n\ntidy(sla_model) %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(columns = c(estimate, std.error, statistic), decimals = 2) %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(columns = p.value, decimals = 4) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(size = \"small\"), # Makes text smaller\n    locations = cells_body()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      effect\n      group\n      term\n      estimate\n      std.error\n      statistic\n      df\n      p.value\n    \n  \n  \n    fixed\nNA\n(Intercept)\n2,815.82\n470.35\n5.99\n9.205345\n0.0002\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeKerwa_Dam\n−708.73\n510.58\n−1.39\n335.981248\n0.1660\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeLower_Lake\n3,421.93\n510.58\n6.70\n335.981248\n0.0000\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeUpper_Lake\n1,109.37\n510.58\n2.17\n335.981248\n0.0305\n    fixed\nNA\nHabitatNatural\n87.08\n510.58\n0.17\n335.981248\n0.8647\n    fixed\nNA\nHabitatRoadside\n−458.84\n510.58\n−0.90\n335.981248\n0.3695\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeKerwa_Dam:HabitatNatural\n76.00\n769.28\n0.10\n336.686482\n0.9214\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeLower_Lake:HabitatNatural\n902.91\n722.06\n1.25\n335.981248\n0.2120\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeUpper_Lake:HabitatNatural\n4,048.15\n722.06\n5.61\n335.981248\n0.0000\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeKerwa_Dam:HabitatRoadside\n919.43\n722.06\n1.27\n335.981248\n0.2038\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeLower_Lake:HabitatRoadside\n1,682.22\n722.06\n2.33\n335.981248\n0.0204\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeUpper_Lake:HabitatRoadside\n698.79\n722.06\n0.97\n335.981248\n0.3339\n    ran_pars\nSite\nsd__(Intercept)\n522.16\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n    ran_pars\nResidual\nsd__Observation\n1,977.46\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosthoc comparisons\nTo find exactly where the differences are.

The SLA in Natural habitats (≈8060) is nearly double that of Roadside (≈4165) or Abandoned (≈3925) habitats. This is a key biological finding: In Upper Lake, Parthenium is extremely “acquisitive” in natural areas, possibly threatening native biodiversity more aggressively there.\nIn Lower Lake: The differences are marginally non-significant (p&gt;0.05). SLA is high everywhere (≈6000−7500), regardless of habitat.\nIn Kerwa & Hathaikheda Dams: There are no significant differences between habitats (p&gt;0.05). The plants maintain a steady, lower SLA (≈2000−2900) across all habitat types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\nTo confirm the interaction visually.\n\n# 1.

It means the Lake and Habitat are the true drivers, and the specific site doesn’t matter much.\n\n\n\nThe Fixed Effects (The “Lake * Habitat” part)\nThe Intercept\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntercept is significant. The LDMC for Parthenium in Abandoned Habitat of Hathaikheda Dam is significantly different from zero.\n\n\n\nMain Effects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLakeLower_Lake is negative and significant = In the “Abandoned” habitat, Lower Lake has significantly lower LDMC than Hathaikheda Dam. Low LDMC means the leaves are more “watery” and less dense. This usually happens when the plant is in a high-resource environment (like the Natural riparian zones of Upper Lake) where it doesn’t need to build “armored,” tough leaves to survive drought. It is focusing on fast growth instead of survival.\n\n\n\n\nThe Interaction Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLakeUpper_Lake:HabitatNatural is significant. It’s not just that Upper Lake has low LDMC. It’s not just that Natural habitats have low LDMC. It is that specifically in Upper Lake, the Natural habitat triggers a massive fall in LDMC that we don’t see in the Natural habitats of the Dams. Parthenium decreases its LDMC significantly in natural habitat in the Upper Lake.\nIt means Parthenium in this specific location is at its least conservative state—it is producing the flimsiest, fastest-growing leaves in our entire study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidying up the summary table\n\ntidy(ldmc_model) %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(columns = c(estimate, std.error, statistic), decimals = 2) %&gt;%\n  fmt_number(columns = p.value, decimals = 4) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(size = \"small\"), # Makes text smaller\n    locations = cells_body()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      effect\n      group\n      term\n      estimate\n      std.error\n      statistic\n      df\n      p.value\n    \n  \n  \n    fixed\nNA\n(Intercept)\n0.90\n0.01\n85.01\n48.53392\n0.0000\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeKerwa_Dam\n0.00\n0.01\n0.12\n336.01865\n0.9075\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeLower_Lake\n−0.04\n0.01\n−2.94\n336.01865\n0.0035\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeUpper_Lake\n0.01\n0.01\n0.56\n336.01865\n0.5790\n    fixed\nNA\nHabitatNatural\n−0.01\n0.01\n−0.86\n336.01865\n0.3931\n    fixed\nNA\nHabitatRoadside\n0.02\n0.01\n1.09\n336.01865\n0.2757\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeKerwa_Dam:HabitatNatural\n0.02\n0.02\n1.09\n337.79297\n0.2750\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeLower_Lake:HabitatNatural\n−0.02\n0.02\n−0.94\n336.01865\n0.3492\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeUpper_Lake:HabitatNatural\n−0.06\n0.02\n−2.98\n336.01865\n0.0031\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeKerwa_Dam:HabitatRoadside\n−0.02\n0.02\n−0.92\n336.01865\n0.3606\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeLower_Lake:HabitatRoadside\n−0.03\n0.02\n−1.33\n336.01865\n0.1833\n    fixed\nNA\nLakeUpper_Lake:HabitatRoadside\n−0.02\n0.02\n−0.92\n336.01865\n0.3576\n    ran_pars\nSite\nsd__(Intercept)\n0.01\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n    ran_pars\nResidual\nsd__Observation\n0.05\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosthoc comparisons\nTo find exactly where the differences are.

Specifically, plants in Natural habitats had significantly lower LDMC than those on Roadsides and Abandoned habitats (p&lt;0.001). This is a key biological finding: In Upper Lake, Parthenium is extremely “acquisitive” in natural areas, possibly threatening native biodiversity more aggressively there.\nIn Lower Lake: The differences are marginally non-significant (p&gt;0.05). LDMC is low everywhere, regardless of habitat.\nIn Kerwa & Hathaikheda Dams: There are no significant differences between habitats (p&gt;0.05). The plants maintain a steady LDMC across all habitat types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\nTo confirm the interaction visually.\n\n# 1.

In contrast, populations in the dam sites (e.g., Hathaikheda) maintained relatively stable, high LDMC values across all habitats, reflecting a more conservative resource-use strategy. The non-parallel lines visualize the significant Lake × Habitat interaction (p&lt;0.05).\nInterpretation: This “crossing” or non-parallel pattern is the visual proof of our significant Interaction Effect. It illustrates that the “Natural” habitat has a unique, stimulating effect on Parthenium ONLY in the Upper Lake ecosystem."

Instead, it exhibits significant phenotypic plasticity, meaning it actively adjusts its leaf traits based on the specific combination of regional environment (Lake) and local land use (Habitat).\nThis is proven statistically by the significant Lake × Habitat interaction in both our SLA and LDMC models.\nThe most dramatic response occurred specifically in the Natural habitats of Upper Lake, where Parthenium abandoned its “stress-tolerant” baseline in favor of aggressive growth.\n\nSLA (Specific Leaf Area): You found a significantly positive interaction.\n\nResult: Leaves here were much thinner and wider (≈8060 mm2/mg) compared to the baseline (≈2815 mm2/mg).\nStrategy: This maximizes surface area to capture sunlight rapidly, a hallmark of an “acquisitive” or “live fast” strategy.\n\nLDMC (Leaf Dry Matter Content): You found a significantly negative interaction.\n\nResult: Leaves here had much lower dry matter density.\nStrategy: The plant reduced its investment in tough structural tissue (lignin/cellulose), producing “cheaper,” flimsier leaves to save energy for rapid expansion.\n\n\nOur analysis, thus, confirms the classic Leaf Economics Spectrum trade-off. The results for SLA and LDMC act as perfect mirror images of each other:\n\nCrucially, this aggressive shift was context-dependent.\n\nIn the Dams (Kerwa/Hathaikheda): The interaction plots showed relatively flat or parallel lines. Parthenium maintained a “conservative” strategy (lower SLA, higher LDMC) even in natural areas.\nIn Upper Lake: The interaction plots showed “crossing lines” (divergence). The Natural habitat triggered a unique, massive physiological change that did not occur elsewhere.\n\n“Our results demonstrate that Parthenium hysterophorus is a highly plastic invader capable of fine-tuning its functional traits to local environmental conditions. In the Upper Lake ecosystem, the plant shifts to a hyper-acquisitive strategy within natural riparian zones—simultaneously increasing SLA and decreasing LDMC to maximize growth rates. In contrast, populations in dam ecosystems maintain a conservative, stress-tolerant strategy regardless of habitat type. This ability to ‘switch gears’ likely contributes to its successful invasion of diverse ecological niches.”"
